## 🚀 What is ClubConnectX?

ClubConnectX lets **club coordinators** post events, **students** browse & register, and **admins** oversee everything — all from a clean, responsive interface.  
An optional AI chatbot helps users find “events this week” or “coding meet-ups,” while a small JavaScript module issues attendance certificates instantly.
